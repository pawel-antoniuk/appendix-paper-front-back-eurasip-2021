# (Appendix) Automatic discrimination between front and back ensemble locations in HRTF-convolved binaural recordings of music 
This repository consist of scripts and data useful to replicate the experiments describeed in the paper "Automatic discrimination between front and back ensemble locations in HRTF-convolved binaural recordings of music" (EURASIP Journal on Audio, Speech, and Music Processing 2021).

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `classification-traditional` contains scripts and data used in the development of the traditional classification algorithms as described in the section "5.1. Traditional classification algorithms" of the previously mentioned article. 
- `classification-deep` contains sources and data used in the development of the deep learning algorithm as descibed in the section "5.2. Deep learning algorithm".
- `convolver` contains the source code responsible for generating binaural audio files used in the experiments.
